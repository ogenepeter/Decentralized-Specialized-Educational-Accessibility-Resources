# Decentralized Specialized Educational Accessibility Resources

This blockchain-based platform enables the efficient sharing, adaptation, and assessment of specialized educational resources for students with diverse learning needs. By creating a transparent ecosystem for accessibility resources, the system connects educational materials with verified student requirements while tracking effectiveness.

## System Overview

The Decentralized Specialized Educational Accessibility Resources platform consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Resource Registration Contract**: Documents educational materials with accessibility features
2. **Student Needs Verification Contract**: Securely validates specific learning requirements
3. **Adaptation Tracking Contract**: Records modifications made to resources for different needs
4. **Effectiveness Assessment Contract**: Measures and analyzes educational outcomes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Blockchain development environment (Truffle/Hardhat)
- Web3 library
- IPFS integration for content storage
- Digital wallet (MetaMask or similar)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/educational-accessibility.git
   cd educational-accessibility
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile smart contracts
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Deploy to test network
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet
   ```

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Resource Registration Contract
Records comprehensive details about educational materials including content type, subject area, grade level, and existing accessibility features. Each resource receives a unique identifier with metadata about formats, languages, and adaptation potential.

### Student Needs Verification Contract
Securely validates and stores specific accessibility requirements while protecting student privacy. Records include verified accommodation needs, learning preferences, and assistive technology compatibility without exposing sensitive personal information.

### Adaptation Tracking Contract
Documents modifications made to educational resources including format conversions, sensory adaptations, cognitive scaffolding, and language simplifications. Creates a traceable history of resource transformations for different learning needs.

### Effectiveness Assessment Contract
Measures the impact of adapted resources on educational outcomes through objective metrics and structured feedback. Analyzes patterns of effectiveness across different adaptations and student needs.

## Usage Examples

### Registering an Educational Resource
```javascript
const resourceRegistry = await ResourceRegistrationContract.deployed();
await resourceRegistry.registerResource(
  "Interactive Chemistry Fundamentals",
  "Science curriculum with laboratory simulations",
  "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/resource.json",
  "High School",
  ["video", "interactive", "text"],
  ["screen-reader-compatible", "high-contrast"]
);
```

### Recording an Adaptation
```javascript
const adaptationTracker = await AdaptationTrackingContract.deployed();
await adaptationTracker.recordAdaptation(
  "RESOURCE-1234", // resource ID
  "NEED-5678", // need profile ID
  "audio-description-addition",
  "Added detailed verbal descriptions of visual laboratory demonstrations",
  "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRzTuh5EYuMqQNwTwBnmC2qAN7TwH5T9NpifziwKLgMtT/adaptation.json",
  "EDUCATOR-921" // adapter ID
);
```

## Features

- **Resource Discovery**: Enables efficient matching of accessible materials to specific needs
- **Privacy Protection**: Secures student information while validating accessibility requirements
- **Adaptation Tracking**: Documents modifications with transparent attribution
- **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Measures actual impact on learning outcomes
- **Collaborative Improvement**: Facilitates community-driven enhancement of resources
- **Incentive System**: Rewards effective resource creation and adaptation
